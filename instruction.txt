Key points of Chronic Care

you should know about
1. Play
2. Ebean - "This is must".
3. Jquery
4. Bootstrap
5. Ajax
6. Mysql

1. For Ebean and Mysql
	
	1. Carefully look at text given at line Number "38-43,293, 301-305, 307, 314-326, 338, 341-355, 355" in "conf/application.conf".
	2. application.conf has documentation link about there section, read it.
	3. also look at conf/evolutions/default/1.sql (auto created by play from the java class[extended Ebean model] path="models/ebeanModel/*.java")

2. Important things when You deploy you code :

	1. Deploy cmd for ubuntu user : "sudo ./gep provision -u=mjain -t=coneng2 --push=acare --tags=acare -k=~/.ssh/mjain.pem".
	2. Ansible Script is on "chronic" branch of umbrella and path for Script is "umbrella/ansible/roles/acare".
	4. When you deploy you code Database automatically created(if not present) with name "ChroniCare" (default if you do not change).
	3. Now if you have a different databaseName,mysqlUser and mysqlPassword and want to change, then change the file "umbrella/ansible/roles/acare/vars/main.yml".
	4. for change For port number change line number 7 in file "umbrella/ansible/roles/acare/templates/acare.sh".
	5. Also change the conf/application.conf for different databaseName,mysql useName and password accordingly.


3. for locally run by ubuntu user. (change application.conf for mysql user and password).
	
	cmd:
	$	        cd Acare (name of project folder)
	/Acare$		path_of_your_Playactivator run

	For database : Create database maually
	mysql -u root -p ChroniCare < medication.sql (.sql file in Acare/medication.sql folder).
	mysql -u root -p ChroniCare < route.sql
	mysql -u root -p ChroniCare < doctors.sql (same for practices.sql , pd.sql).


4. About Careplan
	
	0. "careplan.scala.html"
	1. Acare/public/javascripts/question.js - this is for dynamically add question.
	2. Acare/public/javascripts/addfield.js - this is for dynamically add medication.
	3. Acare/public/javascripts/serialize.js - create json on submit.
	4. app/controllers/Careplan.java - commented code is for send json to redoxEngine.
	5. you need to learn how to use redox. website has all detail on this bit.


5. Need to do.
	1. add code (in umbrella/ansible/roles/acare/tasks/mail.yml) for auto import medication.sql and route.sql on coneng2.

if this is not sufficient then you can ask any time for more.
